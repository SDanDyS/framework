Recordset getRow bug -> Fetches an extra row which is empty.

Recordset setField() bug -> if there is a $_POST or $_GET value send along setField will be overwritten. 
Create a "ruler" paramater which will prevent a $_POST or $_GET from overwriting the developer his input once he sets the field with setField.

(completed) Recordset __construct() -> check whether methods such as setSize() have already been assigned. If yes, prevent it from firing again in the constructor.
Right now it is overwriting the developer his assignment everytime a new instance is created.

Recordset errorHandler -> optimize it so it returns to the developer, rather then exiting the script.

Recordset setImage() -> optimize it

Expection classes -> Add a JSON validator class.

(rebuild) Divide FilesController into 2 seperate classes. One for FILES and one for DIRECTORIES.

Change the "Files" namespace to "System".

DatabaseConnection\Connection bug -> It will throw an error if it cannot find the connection, but this should only happen in its respective environment. 
It should NOT throw an error regarding the "localhost" when we're on the live server. However this DOES happen. It's evaluating the localhost connection.

Create DEFAULT css classes for extra help (this file will also be featured for the image library)

Create a META file with all the required meta tags in (such as resizers)

Recordset relative_id indexes bug -> Program fails to use the first relative id which was assigned to index 0 in setField to multiple layers. Create a method which checks...
whether the returned column is a relative INDEX. If yes, start using the first assigned relative ID to the multiple queries (unless multiple keys have been set)

(completed) Recordset setSize bug -> array_key_exists misses second argument (named $space)

(completed) Recordset setImageObject bug -> Apparently objects created prior to me sending in an image object will throw errors. Create a check to see whether self::$image is in fact NULL
If it is null, return empty (and thus stopts the image processing)
