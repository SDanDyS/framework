# framework

ImageCreator is work in progress and in the state it is in (right now), it can basically be deleted.
The idea of ImageCreator is that a user (developer) basically passes a couple of parameters to the constructor.
The constructor defines whether certain extensions are allowed or not and what the maximum allowed upload size would be.
The constructor will also take an argument which defines what effect should be shown. Simple cards, sick effects etc.
The class basically serves as a controller for the imported libraries we are going to use, with of course, the simple addition that it checks the allowed size and allowed extensions
The class will also contain a couple of methods, which will define transition speeds, directions etc.

I will start making a rough sketch as to what the class will look like. If you are interested, please feel free to give additional info or even help out creating a blueprint.
